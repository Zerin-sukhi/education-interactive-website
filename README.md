# This is my University Website with react.

This is my live link (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Here i mainly do some react router for jumping one page to another.
Here I made a single page for my versity with some external things.

## Here I worked with--

First of all i am using visual studio code.then i used react library and then for css framework i used react-bootstrap and here i used the react router.

### Externally installed

I installed react-router-dom then some bootstrap npm installation is done here.
And i runned it by localhost:3000 with npm start.

## Finally

I build my project for creating the live site.And deploy it in netlify.
